# Basic Training: Add item to an Array

Add the value "codewars" to the websites array.  
After your code executes the websites array **should == ["codewars"]**

The websites array has **already been defined for you** using the following code:

```python
websites = []
```
```javascript
var websites = [];
```
```coffeescript
websites = []
```
```ruby
websites = []
```
```typescript
export const websites: string[] = [];
```
