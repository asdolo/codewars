# True Min

The Math.min function has stopped working, so we have to use our own function.  We are off to a good start, but this function doesn't seem to handle everything properly. Add in the proper checks to return `NaN` for anything that isn't an actual number, except treat `null` like `0`.

Note: This min function need not handle more than two arguments.


    function min(a, b){
      return (a<b)?a:b;
    }
